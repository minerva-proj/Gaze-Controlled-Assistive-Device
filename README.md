# Gaze-Controlled-Assistive-Device

a system that helps the paralyzed people express their needs. The designed project has been realized using aRaspberry Pi 3, a USB camera and aspeaker. Open CV has been implemented using Raspberry Pi to detect face and eye movement of the patient. A GUI (graphical user interface) is designed of 3 by 3 matrix consisting of 9 activities. The designed algorithm detects the movement of eyes. Blinking of eyes will select an activity in the software and the system will display the patient’s interest. The Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology converts the displayed activity into voice.

# The System consists of:
The hardware has been realized using Raspberry Pi 3 and a USB camera
OpenCV has been implemented in Raspberry Pi 3 to accomplish the working of the device
The system detects the face and eyes of the paralyzed patient
An algorithm has been designed to detect patient’s eye blinking
Graphical user interface consists of 3 by 3 matrix of activities 
Each activities get highlighted for few seconds
Normal blinking ratio 2-10(seconds), threshold set >=5.7
The interested activity gets selected and displayed
TEXT-TO-SPEECH Software has been used to convert the selected activity to voice.
